## Introduction

With the rise of streaming platforms, Netflix has become a prominent player in the entertainment industry. This project aims to provide insights into the Netflix content library, trends, and user preferences through data analysis and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the [Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) from Kaggle. It contains information about various movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including attributes like title, type (movie/TV show), director, cast, country, release year, rating, and more.

## Installation and Usage

To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Merrill007/Analyzing-Netflix-Data-using-Python.git

## Analysis Performed

In this notebook, the following analyses are performed:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the dataset.
- Visualizations showcasing the distribution of content types (movies/TV shows), countries, and release years.
- Identification of top directors, actors, and genres on Netflix.
- Distribution and trends of content ratings.
- Duration analysis of movies and TV shows.

## Results and Visualizations

The results of the analysis, along with corresponding visualizations, are present in the notebook itself. Each section of the notebook contains insights and graphical representations derived from the dataset.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcomed! If you have ideas for additional analyses, improvements to the code, or any other enhancements, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
